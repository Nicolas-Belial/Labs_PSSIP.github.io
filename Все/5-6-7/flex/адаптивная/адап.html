      Welcome to the party,
      say hi to everybody
      Paid for by Martini,
      but they're sippin' on Bacardi
      Body's more than just a flesh,
      you can sell it for success
      What's your price what's your address?
      We can finish at my place
      Ever been to Bali?
      I really need some sun
      Such a shame 'bout that tsunami,
      I'll have to go to Cali
      I can get you dressed,
      wrap your body in excess
      Give them something to obsess over
